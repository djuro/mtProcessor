Authenticated User have access to messages list, reports list and "New report" form. 
Report preview is based on it's result data type. It can be numeric or graphic.

User can create reports for available trends and preview result on reports list, 
or by clicking an icon to preview a graph report.

Available trends implementation is basic and just for example. 
It is easy scalable because it involves Strategy pattern solution.

I used Symfony 2 framework and MongoDB database, again because of it's scalability.
